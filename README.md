PSI is a first person, horror-survival game developed in Unreal Engine. 
The player takes the role of a rescue diver with the objective to recover the black box of a recently sunken cruise liner. 
To achieve this goal, the player is equipped with a steampunk, old-style diving suit and a harpoon gun for self-defense. 
They must carefully conserve harpoons and oxygen as they explore the wreck and discover the mysteries of how the ship went down.
